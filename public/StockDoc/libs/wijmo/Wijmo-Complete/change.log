Buttons were being pushed to the next line, added widths to fix the issue.
Added clearing CSS to bring the elements back into the container.

LightBox
______________
Fixed an issue that size is incorrect when autoSize=false.

The first image is not centered horizontally when textPosition is set to outSide.

Move the code for calculating the tooltip's position from the constructor to the show method.  Fixed the issue
that if we add a calendar before the chart, then the tooltip can't be shown in the correct location.

Comments out the code for resizing and added the redraw method to the chart.  Fixed the chart's performance issue

Added width 100% to ui-wijgrid-root selector to make grid fill available space
in wijgrid. Behavior changed: requested by John Ayers. Table should be sized

method. Fix bug: table header overlays on vertical bar.
Top table element width is not correctly synchronized with bottom table.

Added test for 0 width to return width of wijgrid when setting width to 
superpanel. Fixed bug: width of superpanel is not correct when wijgrid is empty.
The widht of superpanel should be the width of wijgrid outer div instead of 0

Re-insert table element before outer div in destory method. Fixed bug: wijgrid 
is not restored for fixedview.  Table element is wrapped in superpanel and 
should be restored to original place when destroying wijgrid.

Column only supports px width at present.

Modified flat view column width calculation algorithm to make width work for 
flat view.  This issue is reported by a user in github forum.  Width should 
work for all mode.
